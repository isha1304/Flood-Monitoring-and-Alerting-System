# Flood-Monitoring-and-Alerting-System
In this, we will made a prototype of this system by using IOT components.
Flood Monitoring and Alerting System will help to monitor water level, monitor temperature and humidity levels, manage regulated flow of water by opening the dam gates using a servo motor and alert the users about flood that will help to protect the environment.
Flood Monitoring and Alerting System uses DHT11 sensor to check the temperature and humidity of a particular area on the basis of that chances of heavy rainfall in an area can be detected.
It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the water level. Buzzer and LEDs will alert the people when there is a flood and servo motor will open the dam gates in the flood condition and control the flow of water, and then close the gates when water level would be normal. We will be using ESP32 as our Wi-Fi module.
A LCD display will display all the readings and this data would be sent to thingboard(a open source IOT platform) where we can create different visualisatiions of all our readings and can create indicators there to show normal and flood condition.
